# IntroML-Final-Project
LSTM and Bi-LSTM for urban air pollution prediction
This project data are collected from China National Environmental Monitoring Center.
This project takes air pollution data of a national ambient air pollution monitoring station in Shanghai, China of 2019.
Each day's data contain 24 hour data of AQI, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3.
A LSTM model and a Bi-LSTM model are constructed aiming at predicting air pollution trend.
